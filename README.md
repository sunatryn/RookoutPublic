- Open the file `src/handlers/homePage.js`
- Add a Snapshot Breakpoint to line 5 by clicking next the the line number in the file viewer
- Looking at the right-hand pane **Breakpoints**, you will see the breakpoint and the line number where you added it - it should be GREEN.
    - If this is not the case, [click here](https://docs.rookout.com/docs/breakpoints-status.html) to see how to fix that
- Go the the app page [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/) in order to trigger the breakpoint
- Check the bottom pane **Messages** and you'll see the snapshot you just added, as it was triggered by the handler of the web page when you accessed it

Go through the [bug list](BUGHUNT.md) and follow instructions to see some basic use cases.

## Common Pitfalls

- Breakpoint status is RED -- Hash mismatch. It means the file used in the server is not the same file used from github/local server in app.rookout.com
- Breakpoint status is GRAY -- No app connected. Make sure you have inserted the Rookout Token in the right place and that connection is made properly.
